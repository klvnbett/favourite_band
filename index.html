    <h1 id="band-history"> HISTORY</h1>
    <p>
        The band was formed by Bunny Wailer originally known as 
        Bunny Livingston, Peter Tosh, and Bob Marley. Of all the
         three, 
        Peter Tosh was the original leader who taught music to 
        the other members and also taught Bob Marley how to play 
        guitar.

The Wailers began as Bunny Livingston, Peter Tosh and Bob Marley.
 Following the 1974 parting of The Wailers, Bob Marley proceeded 
 with his group Bob Marley & The Wailers, with the Wailers Band as the backing band, and the I Threes (Rita Marley, Judy Mowatt, & Marcia Griffiths) as backup vocalists. The Wailers Band consisted of, among others, bassist Aston "Family Man" Barrett and his brother, drummer Carlton "Carly" Barrett, who had been members of Lee "Scratch" Perry's studio band, The Upsetters,[1] with whom The Wailers had recorded some of their most notable songs.


After the death of Bob Marley in 1981, the Wailers Band was led
 by Aston Barrett and Junior Marvin. The band continued to play
  a heavy worldwide touring schedule. Carlton "Carly" Barrett, 36, was murdered at his Jamaica home in 1987.

In 2008 former Wailers Al Anderson and Junior Marvin formed 
The Original Wailers, with the latter departing in 2011.

            In 2014, The Wailers embarked on worldwide 
            "Legend Tour", marking the 30th anniversary of the 
            release of the best-selling reggae album of all time.

            In 2015, Aston "Familyman" Barrett began the process of 
            reuniting past members of the Wailers. Shows occurred 
            in South America which included past members such as Barrett,
            Al Anderson, and Tyrone Downie. 
            The Wailers performed in India for the first time.
            A US and UK tour took place in 2016.

            On August 21, 2020, 
            The Wailers released One World, their first studio album 
            in over 25 years.[3] The album includes the single "One World, 
            One Prayer", co-written and produced by Emilio Estefan, 
            featuring Skip Marley, Farruko, Shaggy, and Cedella Marley.
